## Running the Flashcards Demo App from your Windows machine.

### Get a Webserver running.

You can use any webserver that you are familiar with, but Apache is a good choice.
* 1. Download and install Apache. (Here are the instructions)
* 2. You have to configure your Webserver.


### Instructions for downloading and running Apache on your machine
* 1. http://webdesign.about.com/cs/apache/a/aainstapachewin.htm is a good place to start.
* 2. http://www.thesitewizard.com/apache/install-apache-2-windows.shtml


### Configuring the Apache Webserver
* 1. Go to your Apache directory.
* 2. `cd` into the conf directory.
* 3. Look for the httpd.conf file. This is where you make changes to your webserver configuration.
Uncomment the line `#LoadModule userdir_module modules/mod_userdir.so` by removing the `#` at the front.

`LoadModule userdir_module modules/mod_userdir.so`

* 4. Uncomment the line #Include conf/extra/httpd-userdir.conf. This allows you to set a home directory in your webserver.

`# User home directories`

`Include conf/extra/httpd-userdir.conf`

* 5. `cd` to the extra directory, and open the file http-userdir.conf for editing. (Notepad or any text editor will do, but don't use MS-Word.)
**  5a. Uncomment the line #UserDir "My Documents/My Website" and tell it which directory you'd like to be your UserDir
**  5b. Change the line <Directory "C:/Documents and Settings/*/My Documents/My Website"> to point to your UserDir

* 6. Test that the webserver is picking up the index.html placed in your UserDir correctly.

* 7. If you are able to see the flashcards page, (under your home directory) then your webserver is configured correctly.
